The IA377 is a 02 credits seminars class offered by the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC) at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), with the objective to discuss state-of-art topics in the broad field of Computer Engineering.

Undergraduate and Graduate Students will be exposed to top-tier talks and panel conversations by national and international experts from academia and industry.

The students will be asked to write a summary and answer some key aspects of each seminar. In addition, the students  will learn good practices on identifying the relevant literature of the seminar topics. Along this process, AI tools like ChatGPT will be also explored. 
 
Instructions and materials can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ia377-feec-unicamp).
  
The seminars class in 1S/2023 will be coordinated by Professor [Christian E.
