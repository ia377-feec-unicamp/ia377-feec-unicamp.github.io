**Abstract** 

The Global Network Advancement Group (GNA-G) has brought together the major R&E and mission oriented networks and major data intensive science programs to enable the best use of networks and computing facilities worldwide, while developing the next generation of programmable national and intercontinental networks and distributed systems designed to address the most challenging needs of leading edge programs in a manner compatible with continued excellent service to the at-large academic and research communities. I will review the challenges facing the most data intensive science programs, the mission and structure of the GNA-G and its working groups, the global testbeds and emerging services architecture it has deployed, as well as the recent progress in the GNA-G Data Intensive Sciences and AutoGOLE/SENSE working groups towards the next generation network paradigm, working in concert with the Unicamp, Sao Paulo and Vittoria teams, RNP, Rednesp and the Global, National, Americas and Asia Pacific Research Platforms.

*Harvey Newman, (Caltech).*  

Harvey Newman (Sc. D, MIT 1974), Professor of Physics at Caltech, has been a faculty member since 1982. He was a founder of the US LHC Users Organization in 2007, and he has chaired the Executive Committee of the US LHC Users Association since 2013. In 1973-4 he co-led the team that discovered the fourth quark flavor known as “charm”. He co-led the MARK J Collaboration that discovered the gluon, the carrier of the strong force in 1979. Since 1994 has been a member of CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that discovered the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012, and is now searching for additional Higgs particles, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and other forms of exotic new particles and forces. He also led the MINOS and NOvA teams at Caltech studying neutrino oscillations in 2004-11.

Newman has had a leading role in originating, developing and operating state of the art international networks and collaborative systems serving the high energy physics community since 1982. He served on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Technical Advisory Group that led to the NSFNet in 1985-6. He originated the worldwide LHC Computing Model in 1996. Between 1985 and 2015 he and his team developed and operated the US LHCNet transatlantic network serving the high energy physics community. He has led science and network engineering teams that have developed state of the art long distance data intensive applications transfers, and as chair of the ICFA Standing Committee on Regional Connectivity he has worked on digital divide issues in many countries since 2002. In 2019, he joined the Global Network Advancement Group Leadership Team and in 2020 founded the Data Intensive Sciences Working Group. He and the Caltech HEP and campus network teams are currently developing the next generation architectures and global software-defined network systems designed to meet the challenges of data intensive science programs, in collaboration with many university, laboratory, research and education network and corporate partners.

Newman, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, received a Lifetime Achievement Award in High Energy Physics from the US Department of Energy Office of Science in 2016, the Order of Merit “Jose Bonifacio” Medal from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2009 , and Doctor Honoris Causa degrees from the Politehnica University in Bucharest Romania and from the Pavel Josef Safarik University in Kosice, Slovakia in 2007.
